# Epizeuxis

A toy browser-based programming language for teaching/learning. Pronounced /ɛpɪzuksɪs/ (ep-i-ZOOK-sis).  
Acts as a 'hosted' language, similar to [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), in that interfacing with JavaScript is permitted and encouraged. 

Try it [here](https://phunanon.github.io/Epizeuxis). Core functions are provided as example on how the native functions work, and to make the language more usable.

Native functions:  
`if and or let .. recur val do ! def str println + - * / mod = != > < >= <= vec? vec len nth sect map reduce when eval x->js`  
Character literals:  
`\nl` for newline, `\sp` for space
